# Women care

## üí° Inspiration
In this world, there are so many websites for fashion, beauty, health care and much more. But, there is no proper website for womens. If we observe 81% of womens are struggling without proper guidance. Guidance includes - sex education, parental education, health care etc. There are so many cases which includes Physical Harrasment, Discriminatory Harassment, Sexual Orientation-Based Harassment, Age-Based Harassment, Psychological Harassment. this is really bad for us that we could not reach to each and every women and asking them whether they need counselling, help or something which will boost their confidence. 

So, we decided to `implement this idea`. Our project will help tons of women to encourage, improve and explore. We believe that every women should be independent in their beautiful life.

## üíª What it does

Whenever a user open our website, these 7 options will be displayed . 

- Home - The user can switch to the page where they need help
- Pregnancy - during this time, womens generally go through different moods depending on their livelihood. So, pregnancy page can help them to take healthy food, tips and much more !

- Blog - each wOmen has their own story. Some of them don't reveal the struggles they are facing and problems so if people start sharing their blogs or stories the other users will find this helpful. So that the user can also relieve their problems and overcome the issues. 

- Change language - this website will be helpful for any women in this world. So, depending on the countries the languages vary person - to - person. Hence,we have implemented this option.

- Medicine - There will be so many medicines in front of us. And we probably don't remember whether we can use this as pain killer or for something else. So, we thought of implementing this page where it will help the user to get the correct output of the medicine.

- Chatroom - Sometimes we don't know whom to contact if we face any emergency due to pandemic, the user can utilize the chatrom page. There will the best doctors and the user can be helpful without any stress.

- Select Age - hmm, we don't know at what age we should tell the girlchild about sex education. sometimes we don't have any idea in teenage period and eventually in adulthood also we miss some key points to remember and to be careful. So, if the user click the age then the website will be redirected to the information.
