# Womanify

## üí° Inspiration
In this world, there are so many websites for fashion, beauty, health care and much more. But, there is no proper website for womens. If we observe 81% of womens are struggling without proper guidance. Guidance includes - sex education, parental education, health care etc. There are so many cases which includes Physical Harrasment, Discriminatory Harassment, Sexual Orientation-Based Harassment, Age-Based Harassment, Psychological Harassment. this is really bad for us that we could not reach to each and every women and asking them whether they need counselling, help or something which will boost their confidence. 

So, we decided to `implement this idea`. Our project will help tons of women to encourage, improve and explore. We believe that every women should be independent in their beautiful life.

## üíª What it does

Whenever a user open our website, these 7 options will be displayed . 

- Home - The user can switch to the page where they need help
- Pregnancy - during this time, women generally go through different moods depending on their livelihood. So, the pregnancy page can help them to make healthy food, tips, and much more!

- Blog - each woman has her own story. Some of them don't reveal the struggles they are facing and problems so if people start sharing their blogs or stories the other users will find this helpful. So that the user can also relieve their problems and overcome the issues. 

- Change language - this website will be helpful for any woman in this world. So, depending on the countries the languages vary person-to-person. Hence, we have implemented this option.

- Medicine - There will be so many medicines in front of us. And we probably don't remember whether we can use this as a pain killer or for something else. So, here users can upload/scan images of medicine and get relevant information about the medicine like when this medicine is used, how it is used, etc.

- Chatroom - Sometimes we don't know whom to contact if we face any emergency due to pandemics, the user can utilize the chatroom page. There will be the best doctors and the user can be helpful without any stress.

- Select Age - hmm, we don't know at what age we should tell the girlchild about sex education. sometimes we don't have any idea in the teenage period and eventually in adulthood also we miss some key points to remember and to be careful. So, if the user clicks the age then the website will be redirected to the information.



## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

- Next Js: FrontEnd
- Node Js: Backend
- Google Cloud Vision API: For finding out the name of the drug
- Google Cloud App Engine: Backend Deployment
- Coil: For web monitization
- Firebase: For chatrooms and database
- i18n: For multilanguage support
- Chakra UI: For styling

## ‚õÖ Best Use of Cloud Resources
We are using Google Cloud Vision API for finding out the name of the drug  and Google Cloud AppEngine for hosting our Backend. Vision API offers powerful pre-trained machine learning models through REST and RPC APIs. App Engine is a fully managed serverless application platform with simple administation.

## üí≤ Best Web Monetization Project

We also use Coil to create micropayments for the user you wish, to support them and hence motivate them to keep helping the community. The coil is a free, open-source, and open-source-compliant web monetization platform that allows you to monetize your website for a small fee.
