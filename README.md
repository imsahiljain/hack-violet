## üí° Inspiration
There are several websites dedicated to fashion, beauty, health care, and other topics. However, there is no dedicated website for women. If we look at the statistics, we can see that 81% of women are battling without sufficient supervision. Sex education, parental education, health care, and other forms of guidance are all examples of guidance. Physical Harassment, Discriminatory Harassment, Sexual Orientation-Based Harassment, Age-Based Harassment, and Psychological Harassment are just a few examples. It's extremely unfortunate for us that we can't call out to each and every woman and ask if they need counselling, guidance, or something to increase their self-esteem.

As a result, we decided to put this concept into action. Thousands of women will be encouraged, improved, and explored as a result of our effort. We think that every beautiful woman should be self-sufficient in her life.


## üíª What it does
These seven options will appear whenever a person visits our website.

- **Home** - The user can navigate to the page where they want assistance.

- **Pregnancy** - Depending on their circumstances, women experience a variety of moods throughout this period. As a result, the pregnant page can assist them in preparing nutritious meals, providing recommendations, and much more!

- **Blog** - Each woman has her own tale to tell on her blog. Some of them are secretive about their troubles and concerns, but if individuals start sharing their blogs or tales, other users will benefit. So that the user may get rid of their troubles and solve their problems.

- **Change language** - Every lady in the world will find this website useful. As a result, languages differ from person to person depending on the country. As a result, this option has been implemented.

- **Medicine** - There are a plethora of medications available to humans. We're also likely to forget whether we can use this as a pain reliever or for something else. As a result, users may upload/scan photographs of medicine and obtain pertinent information about the drug, such as when it is taken, how it is used, and so on.

- **Chatroom** - When we don't know who to call in the event of a pandemic, we can use the chatroom page. The top physicians will be available, and the user will be able to assist without feeling stressed.

- **Select Age** - hmm, We're not sure when the girlchild should be told about sex education. We don't always have any notion when we're teenagers, and we gradually forget certain crucial elements to remember and be cautious about as adults. As a result, if the user selects the age, the website will redirect to the information.


## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it
- **Frontend** - Next.js, Chakra UI
- **Backend** - Node.js
- **Google Cloud Vision API** - For finding out the name of the drug
- **Backend Deployment** - Google Cloud App Engine
- **Web Monetization** - Coil
- **Chatroom & DB** - Firebase
- **Multi-language support** - i18n


## ‚õÖ Best Use of Cloud Resources
We are using Google Cloud Vision API for finding out the name of the drug  and Google Cloud AppEngine for hosting our Backend. Vision API offers powerful pre-trained machine learning models through REST and RPC APIs. App Engine is a fully managed serverless application platform with simple administation.


## üí≤ Best Web Monetization Project
We also use Coil to create micropayments for the user you wish, to support them and hence motivate them to keep helping the community. The coil is a free, open-source, and open-source-compliant web monetization platform that allows you to monetize your website for a small fee.
